# shell-scripts
Some shell scripts I use once and a while


# New Project Scripts 

I use these two scripts on my Mac for starting up my initial dev environments using pyenv. 
The first one is for my work folder and the other is my personal folder.

- make_new_Latcha_py_project_03.12.22_v2.sh
- make_new_Stickel_py_project_03.12.22_v2.sh



# Virtual Env backup script

The Virtual Env backup script is older now, but still works if you use virtualenv on a Mac.

- virtualenv_bkup.sh



# Create Random Folders

Fun little script to make a bunch of folders.

- create_many_folders.sh
